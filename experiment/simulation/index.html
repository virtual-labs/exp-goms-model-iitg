		2. You are  supposed  to  record  your  reponses  using  interface-1  and  then  interface-2. <br/><br/>
		
		3. Before  you  start  recording  your  responses on interface 1 press <b> “Start” </b> button to start  recording   time. <br/><br/>
		
		4. Then record   your responses for each subject   using   interface 1 (list-boxes). <br/><br/>
		
		5. After  you  finish  giving  responses  for  all  subjects  press <b> “Stop” </b> button  to  stop  recording  of   time. <br/><br/>

	Why is there a difference in the task completion time? Is it because of  difference in interaction elements  chosen and  their layout?  Is there a cognitive / perceptual factor contributing to task completion time?
	An interaction task is always guided by the user goals, interface operators and  alternative methods available on interface for acheiving those goals. In this respect the above two interfaces can be analysed  using GOMS model. Task analysis using KLM-GOMS model for above interfaces can predict the task completion time before hand. Thus the time and cost for user-testing is reduced.
	You are  therefore adviced to build  a GOMS  model  for  the  above  task  for both  interfaces  and  compare the predictated  time  with  the actual  time  taken for the task.
